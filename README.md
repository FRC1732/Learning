Hello!

Encoders can be used the measure the rotation of a wheel or shaft.

We use them during autonomous to control the robot.

Your goal will be to use a robot fitted with encoders to drive it in a square path.

This will be a little tricky but persevere!

You should use the command based system for the autonomous.

Make a new branch with your group name, then clone this repository into eclipse. It has an example of how to use the commands.

See the DriveBackWardsTwice and DriveBackwards classes in the command package for an example of using the encoders.

Play around with the commands a bit before you try out the challenge.

Here are some resources to look at:
